Small programs I made in my free time

<strong>find_words.py:</strong><br>
  Enter a string a letters and a wordlist (dict.txt, included) and it will generate a list of words that can be made using those letters
  
<strong>longest_alphabetical_letters.py:</strong><br>
  Simply searches through a wordlist for the longest word with it's letters in sorted order (I thought this would be more interesting than Googling it).
  
<strong>sys_solver.py:</strong><br>
  A program that can be used to solve systems of equations for linear algebra.  I didn't test this one too much.
  
<strong>word_freq_ranker.py:</strong><br>
  Given a text file, this program will print to console the top 3 most frequent words in the document as well as create a new text file with the rankings of all words in the document.  I used this to find the frequencies of words in song lyrics.

<strong>check_my_stocks.py:</strong><br>
  Running this program will prompt the user for their stock purchases, including the ticker, price bought at, and quantity purchased.  All given data is stored in a file named 'stocks.csv' which the user can update upon subsequent runs.  The data is used to generate the change in value and net gain/loss of the stored stock portfolio with real time prices.
