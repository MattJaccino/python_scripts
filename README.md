Small programs I made in my free time

find_words.py:\n
  Enter a string a letters and a wordlist (dict.txt, included) and it will generate a list of words that can be made using those letters
  
longest_alphabetical_letters.py:
  Simply searches through a wordlist for the longest word with it's letters in sorted order (I thought this would be more interesting than Googling it).
  
sys_solver.py:
  A program that can be used to solve systems of equations for linear algebra.  I didn't test this one too much.
  
word_freq_ranker.py:
  Given a text file, this program will print to console the top 3 most frequent words in the document as well as create a new text file with the rankings of all words in the document.  I used this to find the frequencies of words in song lyrics.
